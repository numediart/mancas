Matei got a PhD in Applied Sciences from the Polytechnic Faculty of Mons (now within the University of Mons - UMONS, Belgium) end of 2007. 
Matei is interested in human perception and more precisely in human attention/interest from an engineering point of view: how to analyze, predict & enhance people attention?

FROM RESEARCH ...
Matei's research focuses on computational modelling of attention. This mechanism is used by humans to select "important" features in images, videos or sounds. Matei assumes that computational attention is a step towards true artificial intelligence and it should be used in every algorithm which intends to have an intelligent behaviour. He is interested in bringing attention algorithms into real-life for diverse applications (People interest for marketing optimization, Audio-video abnormal event detection for surveillance, ...).
Matei is involved or/and organized several meetings, conferences and workshops. He also has an editorial work (books, journals, conferences).

... TO APPLICATIONS
Matei is strongly involved in technology transfer. He is working on visual communication optimization for marketing through the company Ittention that he founded : [http://www.ittention.com](http://www.ittention.com)

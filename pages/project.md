Short Bio:

Matei got a PhD in Applied Sciences from the Polytechnic Faculty of Mons (now within the University of Mons - UMONS, Belgium) end of 2007. 
Matei is interested in human perception and more precisely in human attention/interest from an engineering point of view: how to analyze, predict & enhance people attention?

FROM RESEARCH ...
__________________________________________________
Matei's research focuses on computational modelling of attention. This mechanism is used by humans to select "important" features in images, videos or sounds. Matei assumes that computational attention is a step towards true artificial intelligence and it should be used in every algorithm which intends to have an intelligent behaviour. He is interested in bringing attention algorithms into real-life for diverse applications (People interest for marketing optimization, Audio-video abnormal event detection for surveillance, ...).
Matei is involved or/and organized several meetings, conferences and workshops. He also has an editorial work (books, journals, conferences).


... TO APPLICATIONS
___________________________________________________
Matei is strongly involved in technology transfer. He is working on visual communication optimization for marketing through the company Ittention that he founded and where he is the CTO: http://www.ittention.com

_Round-abouts scanned in Mons (BE) and Douai (FR)._

Realistic immersive simulations are a suitable solution to the problem. They enable volunteers to be placed safely in "dangerous" situations and to objectively measure their visual attention in a set of characteristic situations that are representative of the infrastructures present on either side of the border. The hypothesis of the project is that the analysis of attention allows recommendations for mobility managers in cross-border cities. This project aims in providing a proof of concept (POC) of a full pipeline from 3D data acquisition to eye-tracking data acquisition.

_Transimmersium three research actions to achieve the goal._

In this context, the micro-project (3 months) has three main actions : 
* 3D Data acquisition of one round-about in Mons and one in Douai thanks to a 3D scanner
* VR Model & Simulation in Unnity for the two roundabouts with car mouvements, different weather, visibility and medical conditions
* Eye-tracking data acquisition based on an embedded eye-tracker in VR headsets of a user making the tour of the round-about
